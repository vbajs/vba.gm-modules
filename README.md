[RickRollar](https://github.com/vbajs/vba.gm-modules/tree/main/rickrollar) - Turns every video into a rickroll, also will never give you up

[oldQuote](https://github.com/vbajs/hjonk/tree/master/oldQuote) - Adds a context menu option that restore's the old Quote option before replies existed. Orignally made by [Cynosphere](https://github.com/Cynosphere), this is a forked verison that is fixed

~~Also note that due to PGP signature being changed, this repo is now untrusted [until this PR is merged](https://github.com/GooseMod/Keyserver/pull/6); If you are unable to add the repo to Goosemod because of said reason, consider loading the modules you want into Topaz.~~

~~**Be mindful that Topaz is in alpha stages, so using the GM modules available here on Topaz may lead to a degraded experience.**~~

Update: As of 6/9/2022, the PR has been merged and the repo should be now verified again!
